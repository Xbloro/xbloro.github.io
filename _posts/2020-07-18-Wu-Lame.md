## Reco

Time to scan, for this one i used ZenMap :

We find the port 21 (FTP), lets check it out !

We have  access and a link to go up in the path so lets try it out .

Maybe i'm childish but i've clicked it so many times ... just to be shure XD.

I think it's a dead end so lets check the other services found:

Ok so we have a Samba running in here. Samba got a pretty bad vulnerability  :

Nice, our target is vulnerable .. time to Exploit.

## Exploit

For this one i've used metasploit. I know its bad for OSCP but it was late and i wanted to be root before going to bed.

Daaaaaaaaaaammmmmnn already root? Using metasploit feel like cheating lol.

![alt text](/assets/images/lame/root.png?raw=true "rooted")

Aaaaand we are Root !
